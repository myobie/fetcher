This is the fetcher. For now, just visit <http://fetcher.nathanherald.com> and see if you can figure out how to use this thing.

## What?

So yeah, I wanted to have a jsonp api to different places so I could
inlude some data on my site. If you want to see more data or more
services, feel free to fork and contribute.

## Tests

Yeah, I haven't really figured out a good way to write tests for this
that don't make me sad. If you come up with something, please let me
know.
